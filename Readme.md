<h1 id="toc_0">Endecryption</h1>

<p>It is a tiny demo of implementation of some encryption and decryption algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong><em>Yes. It is simple and valueless. I write this just for giving some inspiration for the homework to those who will take the lesson taught by Li Hui in BUCT.</em></strong></p>

<p>This tiny program can encrypt plaintext with <code>affine cipher</code>, <code>multiplication cipher</code>, <code>vingenère</code>, <code>rsa</code>, <code>des</code> and <code>md5</code>(actually it isn&#39;t an encryption way, but I put it in encryption just to be simple to implenment).</p>

<p>And also can decrypt plaintext with <code>affine cipher</code>, <code>multiplication cipher</code>, <code>vingenère</code>, <code>rsa</code> and <code>des</code>.</p>

<p>Both encryption and decryption type listed above can be done with file.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">How to use</h2>

<p>In this demo. There are 4 views which have respective functions. They are <code>encrypt</code>, <code>decrypt</code>, <code>key generate</code> and <code>file</code>.(yah..maybe the name may confuse you, and I admit the name isn&#39;t so prcise..)</p>

<p>For each action Type. There are several encrypt or decrypt type. You can choose a type and input some strings acting as plaintext(or cryptograph, depending on you are doing a encryption or decryption) and see the encryption result(or decryption result).</p>

<h4 id="toc_3">example:</h4>

<p>encrypt and decrypt <code>hello world</code> with affine cipher.</p>

<p><img src="Readme_Resource/endecrypt%20gif.gif" alt="affine cipher">  </p>

<p>note that affine cipher takes to integer value as key. And I input 11 and 7 here.</p>
